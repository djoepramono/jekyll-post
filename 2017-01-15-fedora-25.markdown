title: Fedora 25
---

As part of my hobby, I decided to setup a **Fedora 25** on **VirtualBox**

## Why Fedora25

There is no compelling reason really. Mostly because my previous **Mint** box is quiet old (*One year ... :P*)
so I decided to try something new, maybe something not **Debian** based. I used **Ubuntu** for work.

Other reasons:

- Upgrading from **Fedora 24** to **Fedora 25** is relatively painless. *Well that's what I read from the internet*
- Wayland. I am sucker of a better GUI / UX, so Wayland is something that I want to try. *Unfortunately, it needs to be disabled*
- Apart from that it's the usual: more up-to-date software, *Red Hat*'s' siblings, pretty nice DE (Desktop Environment), etc etc.

However during the setup, there were some hiccups along the way

## Installation

When I checked VirtualBox's [site](https://virtualboxes.org/images/fedora/), Fedora 25 is not on the list.
No matter, I just downloaded the iso straight from [getfedora.org](https://getfedora.org/en/workstation/download/)
and installed it by mounting it into Virtual Box's drive.
Once the installation is finished, I disconnected the iso, so that it could go to the actual virtual machine

All good. *Well, not really because the screen resolution was so small and I couldn't bump it up*

### Tidying up

Without installing Virtual Box guest addition, you might have limited control on the virtual machine.
Thankfully this [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBgjUIZmf1Q) video had a pretty clear instruction
on how to do it.

```
$ dnf list open-vm-tools                 # Open-vm-tools is not needed if Fedora is running on Virtual box ...
$ dnf remove open-vm-tools               # .. so remove it.
$ dnf install gcc make                   # Prerequisites for Virtual Box guest addition
$ dnf install kernel-devel-$(uname -r)
$ dnf install kernel-headers-$(uname -r)
```

### Virtual Box guest addition

After that just install Virtual Box guest addition

- On Virtual Box bar, go to **Devices -> Insert Guest Additions CD Image**
- Click and provide the authentication
- Restart the VM

Sadly I didn't get the same result as the video. See below.

## Infinite loop while login

### Corrupted user

Reading from the internet, there were some pointers if that infinite loop during login might be
caused by a user not setup properly/corrupted.

I checked by logging in to the terminal `ctrl+alt+f2` and all seemed to work fine.
Even creating new user and restarting i.e. `shutdown -r now`, didn't really help.

### Wayland incompatibility

Unfortunately for my case, it was caused by **Wayland**. Once I disabled it. Everything works as normal

```bash
$ vim /etc/gdm/custom.conf
```

and set `WaylandEnable=false`

```
[daemon]
WaylandEnable-false
```

**Voila** I got Fedora 25 running!
