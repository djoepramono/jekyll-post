Git never cease to amaze me. This is a bunch of notes about 

## git commit --amend

Useful for:

- Change the last commit message. *I've been using this for a while now*
- Add more changes into last commit as long as you stage it. *I just realised this, a bit late I know :)*

```
$ vi match.rb                                  # make some changes
$ git add match.rb                             # stage the changes
$ git commit --amend                           # amend
... change the commit message if you want to
$ git show HEAD                                # check if your changes is there
```

This is considered as rewriting history, so don't do this on public commits

## git shortlog -s -n

This command shows who does how many commits

```
$ git shortlog -s -n
   100  John Doe
    50  Mary Jane
     4  David Moore
```
